# Colon-Disease-Image-Classifier
## Deep learning image processing model used on kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/francismon/curated-colon-dataset-for-deep-learning. This dataset is comprised of images of normal colons and ones with ulcerative colitis, polyps, and esophagitis.

Keras Tensorflow along with transfer learning from InceptionRestNet (arXiv:1602.07261 [cs.CV]) was used to create the model. The model had 99% accuracy on the training set and 95 percent accuracy on both test and validation image sets. The False negative rate for all image predictions was near zero.
